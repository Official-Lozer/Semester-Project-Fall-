Abstract:
This project serves as an entertainment-oriented game, encompassing features reminiscent of Angry Birds. The key components include: 

Main Menu: 
Upon execution, the initial display is the main menu, featuring three clickable options:

Settings: Redirects to the settings menu. 
Quit: Exits the game. 

Settings Menu: 

Accessed through the settings option on the main menu, this menu provides four clickable options: 
Back: Returns the user to the main menu. 
Music On/Off: Toggles the music on and off. 
Progress: Navigates to a page showcasing previous levels and the scoreboard. 
How To Play: Leads to instructions for playing the game. 

Progress Menu:

How To Play Menu: 
Similarly, a single clickable area in this section directs the user to the settings menu. 

Play Area: 
This section features a back button that, when clicked, returns to the main menu. The game instructions are straightforward: clicking on the leftmost bird activates user control within defined boundaries. Subsequent clicks and drags move the bird along the mouse path. Upon release, the bird is propelled in the opposite direction of the previous drag. During flight, collisions with obstacles result in their disappearance and point accumulation. If the bird exits the window frame, a new bird regenerates in the initial position, limited in number to enhance the game's challenge and entertainment value.
